# Java API Service Starter
 
This repository contains different projects, including a "Hello World" service, an "AI access" service, and a "Terraform test via sqlite" project. The API service is based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-java-service).
 
## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
